# 📋 Project Overview

This project implements a simple AI chatbot designed to act as **Batman's virtual assistant**, colloquially named "Bat-GPT." It provides a conversational interface where users can interact with an AI persona adhering to a specific system prompt (asking for a passcode, responding to "Gotham"). The application features a web-based frontend for user interaction and a Python Flask backend that communicates with the Groq large language model (LLM) API to generate responses.

## Purpose and Goals

The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate a basic full-stack AI chatbot implementation. Key goals include:

*   **Interactive Conversational Interface**: Provide a user-friendly web interface for real-time chat with an AI.
*   **AI Persona Emulation**: Configure the LLM to adopt a specific persona (Batman's assistant) with predefined interaction rules (passcode, specific response trigger).
*   **Backend-LLM Integration**: Showcase integration of a Python backend (Flask) with an external LLM service (Groq API).
*   **Asynchronous Processing**: Utilize `asyncio` for non-blocking calls to the LLM API, improving responsiveness.

## Technology Stack and Architecture

The project employs a client-server architecture with the following technology stack:

*   **Frontend**:
    *   **HTML5**: Structure of the web page (`index.html`).
    *   **CSS3**: Styling of the chat interface (`static/styles.css`).
    *   **JavaScript**: Client-side logic for user interaction and API calls (`static/script.js`). Uses the browser's native `fetch` API.
*   **Backend**:
    *   **Python 3.x**: Core programming language.
    *   **Flask**: Web framework for handling HTTP requests and serving web pages.
    *   **Groq API**: Large Language Model service for generating AI responses.
    *   **Asyncio**: Python's library for writing concurrent code, used for non-blocking Groq API calls.
*   **Deployment (Production)**:
    *   **Gunicorn**: A WSGI HTTP server (listed in `requirements.txt`) typically used to run Flask applications in production.

The architecture is straightforward: the browser (client) sends user messages to the Flask backend via AJAX (HTTP POST). The Flask backend then forwards these messages, along with the conversation history, to the Groq API. Upon receiving a response from Groq, the backend sends it back to the browser, which then displays the AI's reply.

# 📚 File Documentation

## 📄 `README.md`

### Purpose and Overview

The `README.md` file is typically the entry point for understanding a project. It provides an overview, setup instructions, usage, and other crucial information for developers and users. In the provided codebase, this file is currently empty, indicating that the project documentation is yet to be added here.

## 📄 `app.py`

### Purpose and Overview

This file serves as the **backend application** for the Bat-GPT chatbot. It uses the Flask web framework to handle HTTP requests from the frontend, manage the chat history, and integrate with the Groq API for generating AI responses. It defines the core logic for the conversational flow.

### Key Functions/Classes

*   **`Flask` application instance**:
    *   `app = Flask(__name__)` initializes the Flask web application.
    *   `app.config['TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD'] = True` ensures that template changes are reflected without restarting the server, useful during development.
*   **`chat_history` (Global List)**:
    *   A global Python list that stores the entire conversation history between the user and the AI. Each entry is a dictionary with `role` (`"user"` or `"assistant"`) and `content`. This history is crucial for maintaining context in the LLM conversation.
*   **`client = AsyncGroq(...)`**:
    *   An instance of the `AsyncGroq` client, used for making asynchronous calls to the Groq LLM API. The API key is currently hardcoded for demonstration purposes.
*   **`get_ai_response(user_input, history)` (Asynchronous Function)**:
    *   This function orchestrates the call to the Groq API. It takes the current user's message and the accumulated chat history, constructs the message payload required by the Groq API (including a system prompt), sends the request, and returns the AI's generated response.
*   **`index()` (Route Handler)**:
    *   Maps the root URL (`/`) to the `index.html` template. This is the entry point for loading the chatbot's user interface.
*   **`chat()` (Route Handler)**:
    *   Handles `POST` requests to the `/chat` endpoint. This is the primary API endpoint for the frontend to send new user messages. It updates the `chat_history`, calls `get_ai_response` to get an AI reply, updates `chat_history` with the AI's response, and returns the AI's message as a JSON response to the frontend.

### Dependencies

*   **`flask`**: Web framework for building the application.
*   **`os`**: Standard library module for interacting with the operating system (used implicitly for `environ.get` for port, though not for Groq API key directly here).
*   **`asyncio`**: Python's standard library for asynchronous I/O, enabling non-blocking calls to the Groq API.
*   **`groq`**: The official Python client library for interacting with the Groq API.

### Usage Examples

```python
# To run the Flask application (typically executed from the terminal):
if __name__ == "__main__":
    from os import environ
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=int(environ.get("PORT", 5000)), debug=False)

# Example of how get_ai_response is called internally by the chat route:
# (This is handled by the Flask route, not directly by a developer)
# user_message = "Hello, Alfred."
# current_history = [{"role": "user", "content": "Initial message"}]
# ai_reply = asyncio.run(get_ai_response(user_message, current_history))
# print(ai_reply)
```

### Code Comments

*   **Groq API Key**: The API key `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` is currently hardcoded. In a production environment, this should be loaded securely from environment variables (e.g., `os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY")`) to prevent exposure and allow for easier management.
*   **System Prompt**: The system message `"You are BATMAN'S aka BRUCE WAYNE's VIRTUAL ASSISTANT and keep shorter texts. ask for passcode for verification... if he says 'Gotham' proceed talking to him."` defines the AI's persona and initial interaction rules. This is crucial for guiding the LLM's behavior.
*   **`asyncio.run(get_ai_response(...))`**: This line bridges the synchronous Flask request-response cycle with the asynchronous `get_ai_response` function. `asyncio.run()` effectively blocks the current thread until the `get_ai_response` coroutine completes, making the asynchronous call fit into the synchronous Flask handler.

### API Documentation

#### `get_ai_response(user_input: str, history: list[dict]) -> str`

Asynchronously sends the user input along with the conversation history to the Groq API and retrieves the AI's generated response.

*   **Parameters**:
    *   `user_input` (`str`): The current message sent by the user.
    *   `history` (`list[dict]`): A list of previous messages in the conversation. Each dictionary should have `"role"` (`"user"` or `"assistant"`) and `"content"` keys.
*   **Returns**:
    *   `str`: The generated text response from the Groq AI.
*   **Exceptions**:
    *   Catches general `Exception` during the API call or response processing and returns an error message string.

#### `@app.route('/')`
#### `index() -> str`

Renders the main HTML page for the chatbot application.

*   **Parameters**: None.
*   **Returns**:
    *   `str`: The rendered `index.html` template.

#### `@app.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])`
#### `chat() -> jsonify`

Handles incoming POST requests containing user messages, processes them with the Groq API, and returns the AI's response.

*   **Parameters**: None (expects JSON payload in `request.json`).
*   **Request Body (JSON)**:
    *   `message` (`str`): The user's input message.
*   **Returns**:
    *   `jsonify` (`dict`): A JSON response containing the AI's message.
        *   `response` (`str`): The generated AI message.
*   **Side Effects**:
    *   Modifies the global `chat_history` list by appending both the user's message and the AI's response.

## 📄 `requirements.txt`

### Purpose and Overview

This file lists all the Python packages required for the project to run. It's a standard practice in Python projects to allow easy installation of dependencies.

### Dependencies

This file *is* the list of dependencies.

### Usage Examples

```bash
# To install all required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📁 `static/`

### 📄 `static/script.js`

### Purpose and Overview

This JavaScript file provides the client-side logic for the chatbot's frontend. It handles user interactions, dynamically updates the chat interface with new messages, and communicates with the Flask backend API to send user input and receive AI responses.

### Key Functions/Classes

*   **`appendMessage(content, sender)`**:
    *   This function is responsible for adding new messages to the chat display in the HTML. It dynamically creates `div` elements, applies appropriate CSS classes based on the sender (`user` or `ai`), and handles appending a user avatar. It also ensures the chat window scrolls to the latest message.
*   **`sendMessage()`**:
    *   Triggered when the user clicks the "Send" button or presses Enter (if implemented). It retrieves the user's input, calls `appendMessage` to display the user's message, sends the message to the `/chat` endpoint on the Flask backend using the `fetch` API, and then calls `appendMessage` again to display the AI's response received from the backend. Finally, it clears the input field.

### Dependencies

*   Browser's built-in APIs for DOM manipulation (`document.getElementById`, `document.createElement`, `appendChild`, `classList.add`, `textContent`) and network requests (`fetch`).

### Usage Examples

```javascript
// Example of appending a user message (called internally by sendMessage)
// appendMessage("Hello, Bat-GPT!", "user");

// Example of appending an AI message (called internally by sendMessage)
// appendMessage("Greetings. What is your passcode?", "ai");

// The sendMessage function is triggered by an HTML button click:
// <button onclick="sendMessage()">Send</button>
```

### Code Comments

*   **`messagesDiv.scrollTop = messagesDiv.scrollHeight;`**: This line ensures that the chat window automatically scrolls to the bottom whenever a new message is added, keeping the latest conversation in view.
*   **`fetch('/chat', {...})`**: This is the AJAX call to the Flask backend's `/chat` endpoint. It uses `POST` method and sends the user's message as a JSON payload. The response, also in JSON, contains the AI's reply.

### API Documentation

#### `appendMessage(content: string, sender: string) -> void`

Appends a new chat message to the display, styling it based on the sender.

*   **Parameters**:
    *   `content` (`string`): The text content of the message to display.
    *   `sender` (`string`): The type of sender, typically `"user"` or `"ai"`. This dictates the styling and avatar.
*   **Returns**:
    *   `void`: This function modifies the DOM directly and does not return a value.

#### `sendMessage() -> void`

Handles sending the user's current input to the backend and displaying the user's message and the AI's response.

*   **Parameters**: None.
*   **Returns**:
    *   `void`: This function modifies the DOM and interacts with the backend but does not return a value.
*   **Side Effects**:
    *   Sends an HTTP POST request to `/chat`.
    *   Adds messages to the chat interface.
    *   Clears the user input field.
*   **Error Handling**:
    *   Includes a `.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));` block to log any network or API errors to the browser console.

### 📄 `static/styles.css`

### Purpose and Overview

This CSS file defines the visual presentation and layout of the Bat-GPT chatbot's user interface. It styles elements like the chat container, message bubbles, input field, buttons, and sets background imagery to match the Batman theme.

### Dependencies

None. It is a standalone stylesheet.

### Usage Examples

Linked in `templates/index.html` using:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/styles.css">
```

### Code Comments

*   **`.body`**: Sets a Batman-themed background image (`batman.jpeg`) for the entire page, with `background-size: cover` and `background-position: center` to ensure it looks good on various screen sizes.
*   **`.chat-container`**: Defines the main chat box, centering it on the page with a semi-transparent white background and a subtle shadow.
*   **`.messages`**: Styles the scrollable area where chat messages are displayed, including a border, padding, and a semi-transparent background.
*   **`.user` / `.ai`**: These classes define distinct styles for user and AI messages, including background colors, alignment, and spacing, to differentiate them clearly.
*   **`.user img`**: Positions the user's avatar (`logoo.jpeg`) to the left of their message content.

## 📁 `templates/`

### 📄 `templates/index.html`

### Purpose and Overview

This is the main HTML template file that structures the single-page application for the Bat-GPT chatbot. It includes the necessary boilerplate for a web page, links to the CSS stylesheet and JavaScript file, and defines the layout for the chat interface elements such as the header image, message display area, and input controls.

### Dependencies

*   **`static/styles.css`**: For visual styling.
*   **`static/script.js`**: For client-side interactivity.

### Usage Examples

This file is rendered by the Flask `app.py`'s `index()` route when a user navigates to the root URL (`/`).

```python
# In app.py:
@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')
```

### Code Comments

*   **`<meta>` tags**: Standard HTML meta tags for character set and responsive design.
*   **`<title>`**: Sets the title displayed in the browser tab.
*   **`<link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/styles.css">`**: Links the external CSS file for styling. Flask's `url_for('static', ...)` is used for the `batmannn.png` header image to correctly generate its URL.
*   **`<script src="/static/script.js" defer></script>`**: Links the external JavaScript file. The `defer` attribute ensures the script executes after the HTML is parsed, but before the `DOMContentLoaded` event.
*   **`<div class="messages" id="messages"></div>`**: This is the container where chat messages are dynamically added by JavaScript.
*   **`<input type="text" id="userInput" placeholder="ASK BAT-GPT.....">`**: The text input field where users type their messages. The `placeholder` text is customized for the Bat-GPT theme.
*   **`<button onclick="sendMessage()">Send</button>`**: The button that triggers the `sendMessage()` JavaScript function when clicked.

# 🚀 Setup and Installation

This section outlines the steps to get the Bat-GPT chatbot up and running on your local machine.

## Prerequisites and Dependencies

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Python 3.7+**: The backend is written in Python.
    *   You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
*   **`pip`**: Python's package installer (usually comes with Python).
*   **Groq API Key**: An API key from Groq is required to interact with their language models. You can obtain one by signing up at [https://console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys).

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    If the project is in a Git repository, clone it to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    ```
    If you received the files directly, navigate to the project's root directory.

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**:
    It's good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    Activate the virtual environment:
    *   **On macOS/Linux**:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   **On Windows**:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3.  **Install Python Dependencies**:
    Install all required Python packages using `pip` and the `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Configuration Requirements

### Groq API Key

The Groq API key is essential for the application to function. In the current `app.py`, the API key is **hardcoded**:

```python
client = AsyncGroq(api_key="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")
```

**For production or secure development, it is strongly recommended to load this key from an environment variable.**

To do this:

1.  **Obtain your Groq API Key** from the Groq developer console.
2.  **Set the Environment Variable**:
    *   **On macOS/Linux**:
        ```bash
        export GROQ_API_KEY="YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```
    *   **On Windows (Command Prompt)**:
        ```bash
        set GROQ_API_KEY="YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```
    *   **On Windows (PowerShell)**:
        ```bash
        $env:GROQ_API_KEY="YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```
    *   *Note*: These commands set the variable for the current terminal session. For persistent setting, refer to your operating system documentation.
3.  **Modify `app.py`** (if you wish to use environment variables):
    Change the `AsyncGroq` initialization to:
    ```python
    import os
    # ...
    client = AsyncGroq(api_key=os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY"))
    ```

# 💻 Usage Examples

This section guides you on how to run and interact with the Bat-GPT chatbot.

## How to Run the Project

1.  **Navigate to the project directory** (where `app.py` is located) in your terminal.
2.  **Activate your virtual environment** (if you created one):
    *   **macOS/Linux**: `source venv/bin/activate`
    *   **Windows**: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
3.  **Run the Flask application**:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    You should see output similar to this, indicating the server is running:
    ```
     * Serving Flask app 'app'
     * Debug mode: off
    WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
     * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
     * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
    Press CTRL+C to quit
    ```
4.  **Open your web browser** and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Common Use Cases

Once the application is running, you can interact with Bat-GPT:

*   **Initial Interaction**: The AI is programmed to act as Batman's virtual assistant and will initially ask for a passcode.
*   **Verification**: Enter `"Gotham"` as the passcode to proceed with the conversation, as per the system prompt.
*   **General Chat**: After verification, you can ask questions or engage in general conversation with the AI, which will maintain the persona of Batman's assistant.

### Example Chat Flow:

1.  Open the browser to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
2.  The AI will likely prompt you for a passcode (e.g., "Greetings. Please provide the passcode for verification.").
3.  Type `Gotham` in the input box and click "Send".
4.  The AI should now proceed to converse with you as Batman's assistant (e.g., "Verification successful, Master Wayne. How may I assist you today?").
5.  Continue asking questions related to Batman, Gotham, or anything else you'd like to discuss with the AI.

## Code Examples

While the primary usage is through the web interface, understanding how messages are sent from the frontend to the backend can be helpful.

**Frontend (JavaScript in `static/script.js`)**:

```javascript
// Function to send user message to the backend
function sendMessage() {
    const userInput = document.getElementById('userInput').value;
    if (userInput.trim() === '') return;

    appendMessage(userInput, 'user'); // Display user message instantly

    fetch('/chat', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({ message: userInput }), // Send message as JSON
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        appendMessage(data.response, 'ai'); // Display AI response
    })
    .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error)); // Handle errors

    document.getElementById('userInput').value = ''; // Clear input
}
```

This JavaScript code sends the user's input to the Flask backend's `/chat` endpoint using the `fetch` API. The backend processes this and returns a JSON object containing the AI's response, which is then displayed on the frontend.

# 🔧 API Reference

This section provides detailed documentation for the key functions and API endpoints within the project.

## Backend API (`app.py`)

The Flask application exposes HTTP endpoints that the frontend interacts with.

### `GET /`

**Purpose**: Serves the main HTML page of the chatbot application.

*   **Method**: `GET`
*   **Parameters**: None
*   **Return Value**:
    *   Renders the `templates/index.html` file.
*   **Example Response**: HTML content of the chat interface.

### `POST /chat`

**Purpose**: Handles new user messages, processes them with the Groq AI, and returns the AI's response. This is the primary API for interaction.

*   **Method**: `POST`
*   **Parameters**: None (request body is JSON).
*   **Request Body (JSON)**:
    *   `message` (`string`, **required**): The text content of the user's message.
    *   **Example**: `{"message": "Hello, Bat-GPT."}`
*   **Return Value (JSON)**:
    *   `response` (`string`): The AI's generated reply to the user's message.
    *   **Example**: `{"response": "Greetings. What is your passcode?"}`
*   **Error Handling**:
    *   If an internal error occurs during the Groq API call or response processing, a generic error message string will be returned in the `response` field (e.g., `"An error occurred: <exception_details>"`).

## Internal Backend Functions (`app.py`)

These functions are used internally by the Flask routes but are critical to the application's logic.

### `async def get_ai_response(user_input: str, history: list[dict]) -> str`

**Purpose**: Communicates with the Groq API to obtain an AI-generated response based on the current user input and conversation history.

*   **Parameters**:
    *   `user_input` (`str`): The current message provided by the user.
    *   `history` (`list[dict]`): A list representing the preceding messages in the conversation. Each dictionary in the list should have two keys:
        *   `role` (`str`): `"user"` or `"assistant"`.
        *   `content` (`str`): The message text.
        *   **Example `history` entry**: `{"role": "user", "content": "How's Gotham today?"}`
*   **Return Value**:
    *   `str`: The generated AI response. If an error occurs, an error message string (e.g., `"An error occurred: <exception>"`) is returned.
*   **Exceptions**:
    *   This function includes a `try-except` block to catch general exceptions during the API call or response parsing, returning an informative error string.

## Frontend JavaScript Functions (`static/script.js`)

These client-side functions manage the user interface and interact with the backend.

### `appendMessage(content: string, sender: string) -> void`

**Purpose**: Dynamically adds a new message bubble to the chat interface.

*   **Parameters**:
    *   `content` (`string`): The text of the message to display.
    *   `sender` (`string`): Specifies who sent the message. Valid values are `"user"` or `"ai"`, which dictate the styling (e.g., background color, alignment, avatar).
*   **Return Value**: `void`
*   **Side Effects**:
    *   Modifies the DOM by adding a new `div` element to the `#messages` container.
    *   Automatically scrolls the chat window to the bottom to show the latest message.

### `sendMessage() -> void`

**Purpose**: Gathers user input, displays it, sends it to the backend's `/chat` endpoint, and then displays the AI's response.

*   **Parameters**: None.
*   **Return Value**: `void`
*   **Side Effects**:
    *   Reads the value from the `#userInput` HTML element.
    *   Calls `appendMessage()` twice: once for the user's message and once for the AI's response.
    *   Sends a `POST` request to `/chat` using the `fetch` API.
    *   Clears the `#userInput` field.
*   **Error Handling**:
    *   Logs any network or API call errors to the browser's console using `console.error()`.
    *   Prevents sending empty messages.

    *   Semantic HTML where possible.
    *   Avoid inline styles; prefer linking to external CSS.
*   **CSS (`static/styles.css`)**:
    *   Consistent indentation.
    *   Group related properties.
    *   Use descriptive class names.

## Testing Requirements

Currently, the project does not include a dedicated test suite. Future contributions should consider adding tests where appropriate:

*   **Unit Tests**: For backend functions (`get_ai_response`) to ensure their logic works correctly.
*   **Integration Tests**: To verify that frontend and backend components communicate as expected (e.g., sending a message from the UI results in an AI response).
*   **Frontend Tests**: (Optional, but recommended for larger projects) Using frameworks like Jest or React Testing Library (if a framework were used) to test UI component behavior.

Please try to validate your changes manually to ensure they don't introduce regressions or unexpected behavior.
