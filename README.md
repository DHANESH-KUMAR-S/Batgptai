# üìã Project Overview

This project is a web-based AI chatbot application designed to simulate a conversation with "Bat-GPT," a virtual assistant for Batman (Bruce Wayne). The application uses a Flask backend to serve the web interface and to communicate with the Groq API, which provides fast AI-powered responses from the Llama 3 language model.

### Project Purpose and Goals
- To create an engaging, real-time chatbot experience.
- To demonstrate the integration of a Python web framework (Flask) with a modern AI API (Groq).
- To build a simple, responsive, and aesthetically themed user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- The chatbot is given a specific persona (Batman's assistant) and a simple verification mechanism ("Gotham" passcode) to showcase prompt engineering.

### Technology Stack and Architecture
- **Backend**: Python with **Flask** framework.
- **AI Integration**: **Groq API** for large language model inference, using the `groq` Python library.
- **Frontend**: **HTML**, **CSS**, and vanilla **JavaScript**.
- **WSGI Server**: **Gunicorn** is listed in requirements for production deployment.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: **asyncio** is used to handle the asynchronous call to the Groq API.

The architecture is a standard client-server model:
1.  The **Client** (user's browser) loads the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
2.  The user sends a message through the web interface.
3.  The **JavaScript** frontend sends the message to the `/chat` endpoint on the Flask server via a `fetch` request.
4.  The **Flask Server** receives the message, appends it to a conversation history, and makes an asynchronous call to the **Groq API**.
5.  The **Groq API** processes the request and returns the AI's response.
6.  The Flask server sends this response back to the client as a JSON object.
7.  The JavaScript frontend dynamically displays the AI's response in the chat window.

# üìö File Documentation

This section provides a detailed analysis of each file in the project.

---

## üìÑ app.py

### 1. Purpose and Overview
This file is the core of the backend server. It uses the Flask framework to handle web requests, manage the chat logic, and communicate with the Groq API to generate AI responses. It maintains a persistent chat history for the duration of the server's runtime to provide conversational context.

### 2. Key Functions/Classes

| Function            | Description                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `get_ai_response()` | An **async** function that takes the user's input and the conversation history, formats it, and sends it to the Groq API to get a response. |
| `index()`           | A Flask route that renders the main chat page (`index.html`).                                                                            |
| `chat()`            | A Flask route that handles POST requests from the frontend. It processes the user's message, calls `get_ai_response()`, updates the history, and returns the AI's response as JSON. |

### 3. Dependencies
- `flask`: For creating the web server and handling routes.
- `os`: Used to access environment variables (though the API key is currently hardcoded).
- `asyncio`: To run the asynchronous `get_ai_response` function within the synchronous Flask route.
- `groq`: The official Python client library for interacting with the Groq API.

### 4. Usage Examples
The functions in this file are part of the web server and are not typically called directly. They are triggered by HTTP requests.
- Navigating to the root URL (`/`) in a browser triggers `index()`.
- Sending a message from the frontend triggers a POST request to `/chat`, which calls the `chat()` function.

### 5. Code Comments
```python
# The 'chat_history' is a global list that stores the conversation.
# This is a simple approach for a single-user demo. In a multi-user application,
# this should be replaced with a session-based or database-driven history management system
# to keep conversations separate for each user.
chat_history = []

# The API key is hardcoded here for simplicity.
# IMPORTANT: In a production environment, this is a major security risk.
# The key should be loaded from environment variables, e.g., os.environ.get("GROQ_API_KEY").
client = AsyncGroq(api_key="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")

async def get_ai_response(user_input, history):
    """
    Sends the user input along with history to Groq API and retrieves the AI response.
    """
    try:
        # The system message is crucial for setting the AI's persona.
        # It instructs the AI to act as Batman's assistant and defines the initial behavior (asking for a passcode).
        messages = [{"role": "system", "content": "You are BATMAN'S aka BRUCE WAYNE's VIRTUAL ASSISTANT and keep shorter texts. ask for passcode for verification... if he says 'Gotham' proceed talking to him."}] + history + [{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]
        
        chat_completion = await client.chat.completions.create(
            messages=messages,
            model="llama3-8b-8192" # Specifies the model to use on the Groq platform.
        )
        return chat_completion.choices[0].message.content.strip()
    except Exception as e:
        # Generic error handling. In a real application, more specific exceptions
        # should be caught and logged for better debugging.
        return f"An error occurred: {e}"

@app.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
def chat():
    # 'global chat_history' is needed to modify the global variable within this function.
    global chat_history
    user_message = request.json['message']
    
    # ...
    
    # asyncio.run() is used to execute the async get_ai_response function
    # from within the synchronous context of a Flask route handler.
    # This blocks the handler until the async function completes.
    response = asyncio.run(get_ai_response(user_message, chat_history))
    
    # ...
```

## üìÅ static/

### üìÑ static/script.js

### 1. Purpose and Overview
This JavaScript file contains the client-side logic for the chatbot. It is responsible for capturing user input, sending it to the backend server, receiving the AI's response, and dynamically updating the chat interface in the browser.

### 2. Key Functions/Classes

| Function          | Description                                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `appendMessage()` | Creates new HTML elements to display a message (either from the user or the AI) in the chat window.           |
| `sendMessage()`   | Triggered when the user sends a message. It reads the input, calls `appendMessage` for the user's text, sends the message to the backend via a `fetch` POST request, and handles the response. |

### 3. Dependencies
- This script relies on the HTML structure defined in `templates/index.html`, specifically the elements with IDs `messages` and `userInput`.

### 4. Code Comments

```javascript
// This function is responsible for all DOM manipulation related to displaying messages.
// It keeps the display logic separate from the data-sending logic.
function appendMessage(content, sender) {
    const messagesDiv = document.getElementById('messages');
    const messageDiv = document.createElement('div');
    // The 'sender' class ('user' or 'ai') is used for CSS styling to differentiate messages.
    messageDiv.classList.add('message', sender);
    
    // An image is added only for the user's message to represent the user's avatar.
    if (sender === 'user') {
        const img = document.createElement('img');
        img.src = '/static/logoo.jpeg'; // Path to the user's avatar image.
        img.alt = 'Utman Logo';
        messageDiv.appendChild(img);
    }
    
    const messageText = document.createElement('span');
    messageText.textContent = content;
    messageDiv.appendChild(messageText);

    messagesDiv.appendChild(messageDiv);
    
    // This line is crucial for user experience. It automatically scrolls the chat
    // window to the latest message, so the user doesn't have to scroll manually.
    messagesDiv.scrollTop = messagesDiv.scrollHeight;
}

function sendMessage() {
    const userInput = document.getElementById('userInput').value;
    // Prevents sending empty messages.
    if (userInput.trim() === '') return;

    // Immediately display the user's message for a responsive feel.
    appendMessage(userInput, 'user');

    // Asynchronously send the user's message to the Flask backend.
    fetch('/chat', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        // The message is sent in the request body as a JSON object.
        body: JSON.stringify({ message: userInput }),
    })
    .then(response => response.json()) // Parse the JSON response from the server.
    .then(data => {
        // Once the AI response is received, display it.
        appendMessage(data.response, 'ai');
    })
    .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error)); // Log any network or parsing errors to the console.

    // Clear the input field for the next message.
    document.getElementById('userInput').value = '';
}
```

### üìÑ static/styles.css

### 1. Purpose and Overview
This file provides the visual styling for the chatbot interface. It defines the layout, colors, fonts, and background imagery to create a Batman-themed chat experience. It uses CSS classes to style messages from the user and the AI differently.

### 2. Key Styling Rules
- **`body`**: Sets a background image (`batman.jpeg`) and a default font.
- **`.chat-container`**: Centers the main chat box on the page and gives it a semi-transparent background.
- **`.messages`**: Styles the scrollable area where chat messages appear.
- **`.message`**: A general style for all message bubbles.
- **`.user` & `.ai`**: Specific styles for user and AI messages, respectively. This includes different background colors and text alignment to create a conversational flow.
- **`.input-container`**: Uses flexbox to align the text input and send button.

---

## üìÅ templates/

### üìÑ templates/index.html

### 1. Purpose and Overview
This is the main and only HTML file for the application. It defines the structure of the web page, including the chat window, the message input field, and the send button. It links the external CSS (`styles.css`) and JavaScript (`script.js`) files.

### 2. Key Components
- **`<head>`**: Includes metadata, the page title, and links to the stylesheet and a deferred script.
- **`<body>`**:
    - An `<img>` tag for the header image, styled with the `.header-image` class.
    - A `<div>` with the class `chat-container` that holds the entire chat interface.
    - A `<div>` with the ID `messages` which serves as the container for all chat messages.
    - A `<div>` with the class `input-container` that holds the text input and send button.
    - The `onclick="sendMessage()"` attribute on the button links the user action to the JavaScript function.
    - It uses Flask's `url_for('static', filename='...')` helper function to generate the correct URL for static assets. This is a best practice in Flask.

# üöÄ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- `pip` (Python package installer)
- A Groq API Key

### 2. Installation Steps
1.  **Clone the repository** (or create the files as provided):
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended):
    ```bash
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install the required Python packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### 3. Configuration
The current code has the Groq API key hardcoded in `app.py`. **This is not secure.** It is highly recommended to use environment variables instead.

1.  **Modify `app.py`**:
    Change this line:
    ```python
    client = AsyncGroq(api_key="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")
    ```
    to this:
    ```python
    import os
    client = AsyncGroq(api_key=os.environ.get("GROQ_API_KEY"))
    ```

2.  **Set the Environment Variable**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
    ```
    GROQ_API_KEY="YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    *You will also need to install `python-dotenv` (`pip install python-dotenv`) and add `from dotenv import load_dotenv; load_dotenv()` to the top of `app.py` to load it.*

    Alternatively, set it in your terminal before running the app:
    ```bash
    # For Windows
    set GROQ_API_KEY="YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY_HERE"

    # For macOS/Linux
    export GROQ_API_KEY="YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

---

# üíª Usage Examples

### How to Run the Project
1.  **Development Server**:
    For local development and testing, you can use Flask's built-in server.
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

2.  **Production Server**:
    The `requirements.txt` includes `gunicorn`, which is suitable for production.
    ```bash
    gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
    ```

### Common Use Cases
After running the application, open your web browser and navigate to the specified address.
1.  You will be greeted by the chatbot.
2.  The bot, per its instructions, will ask for a passcode.
3.  Type `Gotham` and press "Send".
4.  The bot will verify you and proceed with the conversation, acting as Batman's assistant.

**Sample Conversation:**
> **AI:** Greetings. This is the secure line to the Wayne network. Please provide the passcode for verification.
>
> **User:** Gotham
>
> **AI:** Verification complete. Welcome back, sir. How may I assist you this evening?
>
> **User:** What is the status of the Falcone case?
>
> **AI:** Reviewing the files now. It appears the Falcone syndicate's financial assets have been successfully frozen. The GCPD is moving in on their primary warehouse at the docks.

# üîß API Reference

The backend provides a single API endpoint for chat interactions.

### Endpoint: `/chat`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Receives a user's message, processes it, and returns a response from the AI.
- **Request Body**:
    - **Content-Type**: `application/json`
    - **Format**:
        ```json
        {
            "message": "Your message text here"
        }
        ```
- **Response Body**:
    - **Success (200 OK)**:
        - **Content-Type**: `application/json`
        - **Format**:
            ```json
            {
                "response": "The AI's response text here"
            }
            ```
- **Error Handling**:
    - The backend currently has a broad `try...except` block. If the Groq API fails or another server error occurs, it will return a JSON response containing an error message string. The HTTP status code will still be 200 OK, which could be improved by returning appropriate status codes like 500 for server errors.
